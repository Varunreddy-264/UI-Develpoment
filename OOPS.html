        OOPS:
            -> Data Abstraction
            -> Encapsulation
            -> Inheritance
            -> Polymorphism


            In below example we have worked on abstraction and encapsulation.
            we have not showing the unnecessary details to the user.
            also we have encapsulated the constructor , methods in a single class.

            In the next example we have worked on inheritance and polymorphism.
            we are inherting the porperties or objects or constructor from the above class.
            we are calling the one method but we are getting different output each timee that's cause we are using 
            polymorphism.

        //ABSTRACTION & ENCAPSULATION:
        class Person {
            constructor(name, age) {
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
            }
            getName() {
                return this.name;
            }
            getAge() {
                return this.age;
            }
        }
        const person1 = new Person("Varun", 20);

        console.log(person1.getName());
        console.log(person1.getAge());

        //INHERITANCE & POLYMORPHISM:
        class Animal {
            constructor(name) {
                this.name = name;
            }
            speak() {
                console.log(this.name + " makes a noise");
            }

        }

        class Dog extends Animal{
            speak(){
                console.log(this.name + " barks");
            }
        }
        class Cat extends Animal{
            speak(){
                console.log(this.name + " meows");
            }
        }

        const animal = new Animal("dog");
        const dog=new Dog("Tommy");
        const cat=new Cat("Bella");

        animal.speak();
        dog.speak();
        cat.speak();
